# Shor Algorithm
__Shor's algorithm__ is a quantum computer algorithm for finding the _prime factors of an integer_. It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician __Peter Shor__. On a quantum computer, to factor an integer $N$, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time, meaning the time taken is polynomial in $log N$, the size of the integer given as input


## What is the story?
Let me consider a simple example. We have a number like 15 and we would like to find an its prime facotrs,
